## Core Features

-   **AI-Powered Plan Generation**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to instantly transform unstructured consultation notes into a complete, multi-phase treatment plan.
-   **Dynamic Plan Builder**: A rich, interactive interface to visually construct plans. Users can add phases and treatments, with full drag-and-drop support for reordering.
-   **Template-Driven Workflow**: Start from expertly crafted, pre-built templates or create custom templates to standardize care and accelerate plan creation.
-   **Comprehensive Customization**: A powerful Admin Panel allows for complete personalization. Define every product and service, set default pricing, manage dropdown options, and edit plan templates.
-   **Bilingual Support (EN/ES)**: Fully functional in English and Spanish. The Admin Panel includes tools for managing translations for all custom content.
-   **Professional PDF Export**: Generate polished, patient-ready PDF documents of the final care plan, complete with your practice's branding.
-   **Interactive Tutorial System**: A built-in, step-by-step guide to help new users quickly learn and master the application's features.
-   **Zero-Backend Architecture**: Runs entirely in the browser. All definitions and plans are persisted securely in the browser's `localStorage`, requiring no database or server-side setup.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: React (using TypeScript)
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **PDF Generation**: jsPDF & html2canvas
-   **Icons**: Lucide React
-   **Module Loading**: ES Modules with Import Maps (no build step required)

## Gemini API Integration

The application leverages the Gemini API in two key areas:

1.  **AI-Powered Suggestion**: This is the core AI feature. When a user provides consultation notes, the application sends them to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model along with a list of all available treatments defined in the admin panel. By providing a strict JSON schema (`responseSchema`), we instruct Gemini to return a structured response containing extracted patient data (name, age, sex) and a complete plan broken into phases and treatments. This ensures the AI's suggestions are always relevant and use only the services the practice actually offers.

2.  **Key Instruction Generation**: Within the plan builder, a user can click a "Generate" button to get AI assistance in writing patient instructions for a specific treatment. This sends a simpler prompt to Gemini asking for concise, patient-focused instructions, which are then populated directly into the form.

## Getting Started

This application is designed to run directly in the browser without a traditional build process.

### Prerequisites

1.  **A Modern Web Browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**: The application requires a valid API key to be available as an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`) in the deployment environment.

### Running Locally

1.  Because the application uses ES modules, you must serve the files from a local web server. You cannot open the `index.html` file directly from your filesystem.
2.  A simple way to do this is to navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run one of the following commands:
    -   **If you have Python 3:** `python -m http.server`
    -   **If you have Node.js and `serve` installed (`npm install -g serve`):** `serve .`
3.  Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by the local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## Configuration and Customization

The heart of this application's flexibility is the **Admin Panel**.

-   **Access**: Click the "Admin & Settings" button on the main page.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   **General Settings**: Update your practice name, logo, provider name, and contact information. This data appears on all PDF exports.
    -   **Templates**: Create, edit, or delete plan templates.
    -   **Products & Services**: Define every treatment or retail product you offer. Group them into categories and configure their default properties like price, goal, and required fields.
    -   **Options**: Customize the values that appear in dropdown menus throughout the app, such as "Target Areas," "Frequencies," or "Technologies."
-   **Data Persistence**: All changes made in the Admin Panel are automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`.
